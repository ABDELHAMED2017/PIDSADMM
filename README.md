# PIDSADMM
Matlab code for the paper under review: 'The Symmetric ADMM can be Regularized with Positive-Indefinite Proximal Term'.

Notification:
we use the widely-used MATLAB ADMM package downloaded
at http://web.stanford.edu/Ëœboyd/papers/admm/, with the only slight
revision for our proposed PID-SADMM.

Content of Code Package
The paper contains 2 simulation figures, Figure 1 and Figure 2. These are generated by the Matlab scripts
simulationFigure1.m and simulationFigure2.m, respectively.

The paper contains 2 simulation tables, Table 1 and Table 2. 
These are generated by the Matlab scripts SimulationTable1.m and SimulationTable2.m, respectively.
